## How the App Works

1. **Product Browsing:**  
   Users land on the homepage and see a list of products. Clicking a product shows more details.

2. **Adding to Cart:**  
   Users can add products to their cart from the product list or details page.

3. **Cart Management:**  
   The cart page lists all selected products. Users can:
   - Change the quantity of each item (which updates the cart state).
   - Remove items from the cart.

4. **Checkout:**  
   The checkout page summarizes the cart. Users can review and finalize their order (payment integration can be added).

5. **State Management:**  
   Cart state is managed using React hooks or context, ensuring updates reflect across all components.

## How to Run

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Open in browser:**  
   Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app.

## Customization & Extension Ideas

- **Connect to a real backend/API** for products and cart.
- **Add authentication** for user accounts and order history.
- **Integrate payment gateways** for real purchases.
- **Add product categories, search, and filters** for better UX.
- **Improve UI/UX** with more animations and feedback.
